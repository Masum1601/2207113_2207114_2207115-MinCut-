The code represents a graph using an edge structure that stores two connected vertices. It reads
the number of vertices and edges from an input file and stores all edges so the original graph can
be reused multiple times. A random number generator is used to randomly select edges during
execution. In each run, a fresh copy of the graph is created, and vertices are repeatedly merged by
selecting a random edge and combining its endpoints. During merging, all references to the
removed vertex are replaced, and self-loop edges are discarded. This process continues until only
two vertices remain. The number of remaining edges represents a possible cut of the graph. The
program repeats this process several times and keeps track of the smallest cut found. Finally, it
writes the minimum cut value and the corresponding edges to an output file.
